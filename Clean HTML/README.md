# Clean_HTML

Applies basic text cleaning techniques to strip any formatting from HTML files so it doesn't override the CSS file. Can be very useful if using HTML code cluttered with hard-coded formatting. The old HTML files will not be deleted, but cleaned and saved to a new folder.

Steps: 
1. Combine all HTML files in need of cleaning into one location.
2. Replace the file path for the origDir variable with this location.
3. Replace the file path for the buildDir variable with the location where you want to save the cleaned files.
4. Run the code.
